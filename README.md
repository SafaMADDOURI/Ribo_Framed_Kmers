# RiboFramedKmer (Ribodocs + Riboseq_Framed_Kmers)

## Introduction

**RiboFramedKmer** is derived from **RiboDocs**, a bioinformatics workflow designed for processing Ribosome Profiling (Ribo-seq) data.  
The **RS_Framed_kmers** pipeline automates key steps ensuring a streamlined and reproducible approach for ribosome profiling. This pipeline processes data from raw sequencing reads to ribosome profiling outputs and k-mer analyses.
Once phased ribo-seq k-mers are generated, they are organized into a phased k-mer matrix, where rows represent k-mers and columns correspond to input datasets. 
Using **KaMRaT**, the pipeline constructs the comprehensive **k-mer index** (RSindex) and generates a contig count matrix (contigs are merged k-mers).
These outputs enable further analyses, such as determining which sequences from a list are actively translated. You can query RNA sequences in the RS index to assess their translation status.

### Additional Information on RS_Framed_kmers:

**Framed reads** are those where, for example, more than 50% of the reads with a specific length map to the same frame of the CDS (coding sequence), indicating a P-site that aligns codons to P0 of the CDS. To determine the translated frame among the three possible frames, if more than 50% of the reads translate in frame 1, the reads with that specific length are considered phased.

From the phased reads, the pipeline extracts phased k-mers, which are aligned to the same translation frame. Once these phased ribo-seq k-mers are generated, they are organized into a phased k-mer matrix, where rows represent k-mers and columns correspond to the input datasets. Using KaMRaT, the pipeline builds a comprehensive k-mer index and generates a contig count matrix (with contigs being merged k-mers), facilitating downstream analysis.

## Requirements and Setup

Before running the **RS_Framed_kmers** pipeline, ensure that the following prerequisites are met, including setting up the required Ribodoc Conda environment, KaMRaT for k-mer analysis, and joinCounts for merging k-mer counts.
### 1. Set Up and Activate Conda Environment

The pipeline relies on a Conda environment defined in the `Ribodocs.yaml` file. Follow the steps below to set up and activate the environment.

#### Step 1: Create the Conda Environment

If the environment is not already created, follow these steps to create it:

1. **Install Miniconda or Conda** if it's not already installed:
   - [Miniconda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. **Create the environment** from the **Ribodocs.yaml** file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f /path/to/RS_Framed_kmers/Ribodocs.yaml
   ```

3. **List your environments**:
   After creating the environment, run the following to get the path of the created environment:
   ```bash
   conda info --envs
   ```

4. **Activate the environment**:
   Using the path or the environment name from the previous command, activate your environment:
   ```bash
   source /home/yourusername/miniconda3/bin/activate your_environment_name
   ```

### 2. Install and Configure KaMRaT

The pipeline uses **KaMRaT** for k-mer analysis. Follow these steps to download and configure the **KaMRaT** Singularity image:

1. **Download the KaMRaT Singularity image (.sif)** from the official GitHub repository:
   - [KaMRaT GitHub](https://github.com/Transipedia/KaMRaT)

2. Use the following command to download the image:
   ```bash
   singularity pull KaMRaT.sif docker://transipedia/kamrat:latest
   ```

3. **Configure the path** to the downloaded image in the `config.yaml` file under the `kamratImg` key:
   ```yaml
   kamratImg: "/path/to/KaMRaT.sif"
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/KaMRaT.sif` with the actual path where the Singularity image is located.

---

### 3. Install and Configure joinCounts

**joinCounts** is used for merging k-mer counts. You can find it on GitHub at the following link:  
- [joinCounts GitHub](https://github.com/Transipedia/dekupl-joinCounts)

1. **Clone and install joinCounts**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Transipedia/dekupl-joinCounts.git
   cd dekupl-joinCounts
   make
   ```

2. **Set the path** to `joinCounts` in the `config.yaml` file:
   ```yaml
   pathJoinCounts: "$PATH:/path/to/dekupl-joinCounts"
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/dekupl-joinCounts` with the actual path to the `joinCounts` executable.


## Results Directory Structure

The results generated by the **RS_Framed_kmers** pipeline are organized into several key directories:

- **BAM_transcriptome.25-35/**: Contains BAM and BAM index files of aligned reads to the transcriptome.
- **adapter_lists/**: Stores adapter sequences detected or used for trimming.
- **annex_database/**: Contains reference indices (Bowtie2 and Hisat2), GFF files, and other annotations used for the analysis.
- **cutadapt/**: Trimmed FastQ files for each sample after adapter removal.
- **fastqc/**: FastQC quality reports before and after trimming.
- **kmerCount/**: Results of k-mer counting, including individual k-mer counts for each sample, final merged k-mer result (`merged-res.tsv`) and the kmers index.
- **no-outRNA/**: FastQ files with rRNA reads removed.
- **riboWaltz.25-35/**: Results from riboWaltz analysis, including P-site offset data, periodicity plots, and frame-shift analysis.

Below is a concise tree structure of the key output directories:

```bash
|-- BAM_transcriptome.25-35/
|-- adapter_lists/
|-- annex_database/
|   |-- NamedCDS_human.gff3
|   |-- index_files/
|-- cutadapt/
|-- fastqc/
|   |-- fastqc_after_trimming/
|   |-- fastqc_before_trimming/
|-- kmerCount/
|   |-- Kamrat/
|   |   |-- index/
|   |   |   |-- idx-mat.bin
|   |   |   |-- idx-meta.bin
|   |   |   |-- idx-pos.bin
|   |   └── merged-res.tsv
|   |-- Kmer/
|   |   └── SRR2146892_1.tsv
|   └-- Matrix/
|       └── matrixFilteredHeader.tsv
|-- no-outRNA/
|-- riboWaltz.25-35/
|   |-- best_offset.csv
|   |-- frame_psite.tiff
|   |-- frame_psite_length.csv
|   |-- frame_psite_length.tiff
|   |-- psite_offset.csv
|   |-- psite_table_forKmerCount.txt
|   |-- psite_table_offset.csv
|   |-- transcriptome_elongated.SRR2146892_1/
|   |-- transcriptome_elongated.SRR23563666/
```
The main outputs are the RS index (`kmerCount/Kamrat/index`), the k-mer count table (`kmerCount/Matrix/matrixFilteredHeader.tsv`), and the contig count table (`kmerCount/Kamrat/merged-res.tsv`), where contigs represent merged k-mers.

## Configuration

The pipeline relies on a configuration file that defines project-specific settings such as paths, reference files, trimming settings, k-mer analysis parameters, and more. This configuration file (`coThe pipeline uses a configuration file (`config.yaml`) that defines project-specific settings, including paths, reference files, trimming parameters, k-mer analysis settings, and more. This file must be tailored to your specific environment and data.
Your working directory should contain a `fastq` directory for your FASTQ files, as well as a `database` directory for the reference files specified in the configuration file.
Below is an example of the key sections from the `config.yaml` file:
